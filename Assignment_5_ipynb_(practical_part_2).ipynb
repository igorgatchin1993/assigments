        "The following assignment consists of a theoretical part (learning portfolio) and a practical part (assignment). The goal is to build a classification model that predicts from which subject area a certain abstract originates. The plan would be that next week we will discuss your learnings from the theory part, that means you are relatively free to fill your Learning Portfolio on this new topic and in two weeks we will discuss your solutions of the Classification Model.\n",

        "1) Preprocessing: The data which I provide as zip in Olat must be processed first, that means we need a table which has the following form:\n",

        "\n",
        "The research field is determined by the name of the file.\n",

        "2) We need a training dataset and a test dataset. My suggestion would be that for each research field we use the first 5700 lines for the training dataset and the last 300 lines for the test dataset. Please stick to this because then we can compare our models better!\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Please use a pre-trained model from huggingface to build a classification model that tries to predict the correct research field from the 26. Please calculate the accuracy and the overall accuracy for all research fields. If you solve this task in a group, you can also try different pre-trained models. In addition to the abstracts, you can also see if the model improves if you include keywords and titles.\n",
